# GregEx

Welcome!

This is the start of GregEx, a React Native app that experiments with Regular Expression.


## Background

One day during lunch, one of our colleagues mistakenly refered to another colleague named "Greg" as "Green," and the nickname stuck eversince. Crazy, I know!

At the same, my goal for personal development was to improve my knowledge in Regular Expression and React Native, so I decided to combine both, which lead me to the development of GregEx.

The app takes a string, and if it matches "Greg," it will convert to "Green."
